	#. You can also confirm tomcat was started by going to http://localhost:8080 in a browser

#. Jump to the `Building and Installing MOTECH`_ section to install MOTECH


Installing on a Macintosh 
==========================

#. Installing Prerequisites for MOTECH

	#. Installing HomeBrew_
		
		.. _HomeBrew: http://brew.sh/

		To install Homebrew, run the following in the terminal 
		
		.. code-block:: bash

			ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"


	#. Use Homebrew to install git, erlang, ActiveMQ, and Apache Tomcat:
		.. code-block:: bash

			brew install git
			brew install activemq
			brew install tomcat
			brew install maven

	#. Homebrew installations are located ``in /usr/local/Cellar` with symlinks in ``/usr/local/bin``, which should already be part of your $PATH environment variable.

		.. note:: 

			Homebrew provides instructions about how to run these applications, as well as how to have launchd start them automatically on system startup.
	
	#. Configuring Tomcat:

		Edit the ``tomcat-users.xml`` file to add an admin user. Insert a line similar to the following before the closing ``</tomcat-users>`` tag::

	    	<user username="motech" password="motech" roles="manager-gui"/>

	#. Installing JDK 7:

		Mac OS includes JDK6 by default, however JDK 7 is required for MOTECH. Use these instructions_ to install the latest version of the JDK.
			
			.. _instructions: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/teaching/gatech/cs2340/guides/java7-macosx.html

	#. Installing MySQL:

		a. Before installing MySQL, you will need Xcode from the App Store. This can take a while; it’s a big download.

		b. Next start Xcode from the Launchpad (rocketship icon in the dock) and select Install. Then you can quit Xcode; you don’t need to keep it running.

			.. note::

				(Command Line Tools using Xcode are included in OS X Mavericks, but not previous OS versions. If you are running Mountain Lion, you can follow these instructions: http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2012/12/10/mountain-lion-pre-mysql/)

		c. Go to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ and download the appropriate DMG archive. Open it, double-click on the installer, and follow directions. 

		d. Once mysql has finished installing, double-click the MySQL preferences pane in the DMG and follow instructions. For more details see 'these instructions'_ . 

		.. _these instructions: http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2011/02/10/mac-os-x-mysql-install/

			.. note::
				Homebrew can be used to install MySQL, however Homebrew will not install the Mysql System Preferences control panel. 

#. Setting up Symbolic Link and Environment Variables

	#. Create a symbolic link from the Tomcat directory (Homebrew installs into ``/usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/<version number>/libexec``) to ``/usr/local/tomcat``:
		
		.. code:: bash
			
			ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/`brew info tomcat | grep stable | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/,//'`/libexec /usr/local/tomcat

	#. Edit your ``~/.bash_profile`` to set environment variables (catalina is Tomcat)::

		export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/Home"
		export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"
		export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/tomcat"
		export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m"
		export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH

	#. When you’re done editing:
		.. code:: bash
		
			source ~/.bash_profile

#. Jump to the `Building and Installing MOTECH`_ section to install MOTECH

.. _`Building and Installing MOTECH`:

Building and Installing MOTECH
===============================

#. Getting the MOTECH code

	`List of MOTECH repositories`_

		.. _List of MOTECH repositories: https://code.google.com/p/motech/wiki/Repositories

	`Generic developer git workflow`_

		.. _Generic developer git workflow :  https://code.google.com/p/motech/wiki/DeveloperDocumentation

#. Building MOTECH

	a. Assuming you issued the git clone command in your home directory root, in the terminal

		.. code:: bash

			$ cd ~/motech
			$ mvn install

	b.) It takes some time to build MOTECH, but eventually you should see::

		[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
		[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		[INFO] Total time: 29:19.284s
		[INFO] Finished at: Fri Jun 07 12:12:43 PDT 2013
		[INFO] Final Memory: 152M/378M
		[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	.. note::
		Should you get a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception, it may be because you forgot to set MAVEN_OPT as described in [3.5]. But you may need to increase -Xmx. So something like -Xmx1024m might work.

#. Install MOTECH

	#. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8080

		.. image:: tomcat-admin.png
		   :scale: 100 %
		   :alt: Tomcat server home page
		   :align: center

	#. Click on Manager App

	#. Type the user/password you used in tomcat-users.xml

	#. Click +

	#. Select JDK

	#. Select /home/frank/jdk1.7.0_21, then click OK

	#. Click Next

	#. Click Finish

	#. Background processes will take a long time

	#. You can also create a menu launcher, so you can start IntelliJ from the gui:

		#. From the Tools menu select Create Desktop Entry

		#. A IntelliJ menu item will be created in the Development application group

		#. Debug demo module in IntelliJ

		#. Start IntelliJ (from the command line, or from launcher icon if you created one)

		#. It’ll automatically open the motech project (if it was the last project you worked on)

		#. From the Run menu select Edit Configurations

		#. Click on the green +

		#. Select Remote

		#. Give a name to your Run/Debug configuration and change the port to 8000 as:

		   		:align: center

		#. Hit OK

		#. Set a breakpoint somewhere in the demo module code, i.e.:
		
			

		#. From the Run menu, select Debug 'Tomcat' where Tomcat is the name of your configuration.

		#. In the browser go to the place that will hit the breakpoint, i.e.: if you setup a breakpoint as in the previous screen, then in the Demo module, click the Decision Trees tab, and you should hit the breakpoint!
